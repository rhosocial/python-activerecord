# Version Migration and Upgrades

This chapter covers the essential aspects of managing schema changes, data migrations, and transitioning from other ORM frameworks to Python ActiveRecord.

## Overview

As applications evolve, database schemas often need to change to accommodate new features, improve performance, or fix design issues. Python ActiveRecord provides tools and patterns to manage these changes effectively while minimizing disruption to your application.

## Topics Covered

- [Schema Change Management](schema_change_management.md) - How to handle database schema evolution
- [Data Migration Strategies](data_migration_strategies.md) - Techniques for moving and transforming data
- [Migrating from Other ORMs to ActiveRecord](migrating_from_other_orms.md) - Guidelines for transitioning from SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or Peewee

## Key Concepts

- **Schema Versioning**: Tracking database schema versions to ensure consistent deployments
- **Migration Scripts**: Creating and managing scripts that transform database structures
- **Data Transformation**: Strategies for converting data between different schemas
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with previous versions during transitions
- **Testing Migrations**: Validating migration scripts before production deployment

Effective migration management is crucial for maintaining application stability while allowing your data model to evolve with changing requirements.
