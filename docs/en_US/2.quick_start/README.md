## Overview

Python ActiveRecord is a modern ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework that follows the ActiveRecord pattern, providing an intuitive interface for database operations. It combines the simplicity of the ActiveRecord pattern with the type safety of Pydantic.

The framework allows you to:

- Define models that map to database tables
- Perform CRUD operations with minimal code
- Build complex queries with a fluent interface
- Manage relationships between models
- Handle transactions with proper isolation levels

This quick start guide will walk you through the basics using SQLite, which is included with Python and requires no additional setup. Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can explore more advanced features or switch to other database backends.
