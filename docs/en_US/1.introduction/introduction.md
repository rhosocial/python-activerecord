# Introduction

The ActiveRecord design pattern bridges the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases.
This guide compares rhosocial ActiveRecord with three popular Python ORM solutions: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee. We'll examine their design philosophies, feature sets, performance characteristics, and provide specific code examples to help you choose the right tool for your needs.

rhosocial ActiveRecord is a modern, Pythonic implementation of the ActiveRecord design pattern, providing an elegant and intuitive interface for database operations with type safety and rich features. Built on the ActiveRecord pattern popularized by Ruby on Rails, this library has made significant innovations on that pattern, offering a clean, model-centric approach to database access that significantly reduces boilerplate code while maintaining flexibility and performance.

The library allows developers to represent database tables as Python classes and rows as objects, creating a natural
mapping between object-oriented domain models and relational database structures. This approach emphasizes convention
over configuration, making database operations more intuitive and less error-prone.
