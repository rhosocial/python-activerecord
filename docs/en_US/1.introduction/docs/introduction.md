# Introduction

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks bridge the gap between object-oriented programming and relational databases.
This guide compares Python ActiveRecord with three popular Python ORM solutions: SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, and Peewee. We'll examine their design philosophies, feature sets, performance characteristics, and provide specific code examples to help you choose the right tool for your needs.

Python ActiveRecord is a robust object-relational mapping (ORM) library that provides an intuitive interface for
database interactions in Python applications. Built on the ActiveRecord pattern popularized by Ruby on Rails,
this library offers a clean, model-centric approach to database access that significantly reduces boilerplate code
while maintaining flexibility and performance.

The library allows developers to represent database tables as Python classes and rows as objects, creating a natural
mapping between object-oriented domain models and relational database structures. This approach emphasizes convention
over configuration, making database operations more intuitive and less error-prone.
