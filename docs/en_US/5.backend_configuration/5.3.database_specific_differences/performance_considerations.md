1. **Proper Indexing**: Ensure appropriate indexes are in place for frequently queried columns
2. **Query Optimization**: Write efficient queries that retrieve only the data you need
3. **Connection Management**: Use connection pooling to reduce connection overhead
4. **Batch Operations**: Use batch operations for bulk inserts, updates, and deletes
5. **Caching**: Implement appropriate caching strategies to reduce database load
6. **Denormalization**: Consider strategic denormalization for read-heavy workloads
7. **Regular Maintenance**: Perform regular database maintenance (statistics updates, vacuum, etc.)

## Database-Specific Performance Characteristics

Each database system has unique performance characteristics and optimization techniques.

### SQLite

#### Strengths

- **Low Overhead**: Minimal resource requirements
- **Zero Configuration**: No server setup or management required
- **Single File**: Entire database in a single file, easy to backup and transfer
- **Read Performance**: Excellent read performance for single-user scenarios

#### Limitations

- **Concurrency**: Limited write concurrency (one writer at a time)
- **Scalability**: Not designed for high-concurrency or large-scale applications
- **Network Access**: Not designed for network access (though possible with extensions)

#### Optimization Tips

1. **Journal Mode**: Use WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better concurrency
   ```python
   # Configure WAL mode
   connection.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;")
   ```

2. **Synchronous Setting**: Adjust synchronous setting for performance vs. safety tradeoff
   ```python
   # Normal safety (default)
   connection.execute("PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;")
   # Maximum performance but risk of corruption on system crash
   connection.execute("PRAGMA synchronous=OFF;")
   ```

3. **Memory Usage**: Increase cache size for better performance
   ```python
   # Set cache size to 10000 pages (usually 4KB each)
   connection.execute("PRAGMA cache_size=10000;")
   ```

4. **Temporary Tables**: Use temporary tables for complex intermediate results

5. **Bulk Operations**: Use transactions for bulk operations
   ```python
   with connection.transaction():
       # Perform multiple operations
       # ...
   ```

## Query Optimization Techniques

### Using EXPLAIN/EXECUTION PLANS

Python ActiveRecord provides a unified interface for obtaining query execution plans:

```python
# Get execution plan for a query
query = User.where(status='active').order_by('created_at')
plan = query.explain()
print(plan)
```

Each database system has its own EXPLAIN format and options:

| Database      | EXPLAIN Features                                     |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| SQLite        | Basic query plan with index usage                   |
| MySQL/MariaDB | Visual execution plan with cost estimates           |
| PostgreSQL    | Detailed plan with cost estimates and buffer usage  |
| Oracle        | EXPLAIN PLAN with detailed execution steps          |
| SQL Server    | Graphical execution plan with detailed statistics   |

### Query Rewriting Techniques

1. **Avoid SELECT ***: Only select the columns you need

2. **Use Specific Joins**: Use the most appropriate join type (INNER, LEFT, etc.)

3. **Subquery Optimization**: Rewrite subqueries as joins when possible

4. **LIMIT Early**: Apply LIMIT as early as possible in the query

5. **Use EXISTS Instead of IN**: For checking existence in large datasets

6. **Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns**: Functions on indexed columns prevent index usage

## Index Strategies

### Common Index Types

| Index Type    | Best For                                            | Database Support                                   |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| B-tree        | General-purpose, equality and range queries        | All databases                                      |
| Hash          | Equality comparisons only                          | PostgreSQL, SQL Server (memory-optimized tables)   |
| GIN           | Full-text search, array containment, JSONB         | PostgreSQL                                         |
| BRIN          | Large tables with ordered data                     | PostgreSQL                                         |
| Spatial       | Geometric data                                     | All major databases (different implementations)    |
| Full-text     | Text search                                        | All major databases (different implementations)    |
| Bitmap        | Low-cardinality columns, data warehousing          | Oracle, PostgreSQL                                 |
| Clustered     | Primary access pattern                             | SQL Server, MySQL/InnoDB, PostgreSQL (via CLUSTER) |

### Index Maintenance

Regular index maintenance is crucial for performance:

| Database      | Index Maintenance Commands                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| SQLite        | `ANALYZE`                                           |
| MySQL/MariaDB | `ANALYZE TABLE`                                     |
| PostgreSQL    | `REINDEX`, `VACUUM`                                 |
| Oracle        | `ALTER INDEX ... REBUILD`                           |
| SQL Server    | `ALTER INDEX ... REORGANIZE`, `ALTER INDEX ... REBUILD` |

## Connection and Pool Management

Connection pooling is essential for performance in multi-user applications. Python ActiveRecord provides connection pooling capabilities that should be configured based on your database system and workload:

```python
config = ConnectionConfig(
    # ...
    pool_size=10,               # Maximum number of connections in the pool
    pool_timeout=30,            # Seconds to wait for a connection from the pool
    pool_recycle=3600,          # Recycle connections after this many seconds
    max_overflow=5              # Allow this many connections beyond pool_size
)
```

Optimal pool settings vary by database system:

| Database      | Connection Characteristics                          | Recommended Pool Strategy                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| SQLite        | Very lightweight, file-based                        | Smaller pool size, longer recycle time           |
| MySQL/MariaDB | Moderate overhead                                   | Moderate pool size, regular recycling            |
| PostgreSQL    | Moderate overhead, process per connection           | Consider external pooler (pgBouncer) for high-connection scenarios |
| Oracle        | Higher overhead                                     | Careful pool sizing, consider connection broker   |
| SQL Server    | Moderate overhead                                   | Moderate pool size, regular recycling            |

## Transaction Performance

Transaction management affects performance significantly:

### Isolation Levels

Higher isolation levels provide more consistency but may reduce concurrency:

| Isolation Level        | Consistency | Concurrency | Use Case                                        |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|
| READ UNCOMMITTED       | Lowest      | Highest     | Reporting, non-critical reads                  |
| READ COMMITTED         | Low         | High        | General-purpose operations                     |
| REPEATABLE READ        | Medium      | Medium      | Operations requiring consistent reads          |
| SERIALIZABLE           | Highest     | Lowest      | Financial transactions, critical operations    |

### Transaction Duration

1. **Keep Transactions Short**: Long-running transactions hold locks and resources
2. **Batch Operations**: Group related operations in a single transaction
3. **Avoid User Input During Transactions**: Never wait for user input inside a transaction

## Caching Strategies

Python ActiveRecord supports various caching strategies:

1. **Query Result Caching**: Cache the results of frequently executed queries
2. **Model Caching**: Cache frequently accessed model instances
3. **Relationship Caching**: Cache related objects to reduce database queries

Caching effectiveness varies by database system and workload:

| Database      | Built-in Caching Features                           | External Caching Recommendations                  |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| SQLite        | Page cache, shared memory mode                      | Application-level caching                        |
| MySQL/MariaDB | Query cache (deprecated in 8.0+), buffer pool       | Application-level caching, Redis/Memcached       |
| PostgreSQL    | Shared buffers, OS cache                            | Application-level caching, Redis/Memcached       |
| Oracle        | Buffer cache, result cache                          | Application-level caching, coherence cache       |
| SQL Server    | Buffer pool, procedure cache, query store           | Application-level caching, Redis/Memcached       |

## Large Dataset Handling

Strategies for handling large datasets vary by database system:

### Pagination

Efficient pagination techniques:

| Database      | Efficient Pagination Technique                       |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| SQLite        | LIMIT/OFFSET for moderate datasets                  |
| MySQL/MariaDB | LIMIT/OFFSET with indexed columns                   |
| PostgreSQL    | Keyset pagination for large datasets                |
| Oracle        | Row number windowing for large datasets             |
| SQL Server    | OFFSET/FETCH or keyset pagination                   |

### Bulk Operations

Bulk operation performance varies significantly:

| Database      | Bulk Insert Method                                   | Bulk Update Method                               |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| SQLite        | Multi-value INSERT                                  | Transaction with multiple UPDATEs                |
| MySQL/MariaDB | Multi-value INSERT                                  | Multi-table UPDATE                               |
| PostgreSQL    | COPY command or multi-value INSERT                  | Common Table Expression (CTE) with UPDATE        |
| Oracle        | Direct-path INSERT or multi-value INSERT            | MERGE statement                                  |
| SQL Server    | BULK INSERT or table-valued parameters              | MERGE statement                                  |

Python ActiveRecord provides batch operation methods that use the most efficient approach for each database system.

## Monitoring and Profiling

Each database system provides different tools for monitoring and profiling:

| Database      | Monitoring Tools                                     | Key Metrics to Watch                             |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| SQLite        | EXPLAIN, PRAGMA stats                              | Query execution time, index usage                |
| MySQL/MariaDB | SHOW PROCESSLIST, Performance Schema                | Slow queries, lock contention, buffer pool usage |
| PostgreSQL    | pg_stat_* views, pg_stat_statements                | Slow queries, index usage, buffer hits vs. reads |
| Oracle        | AWR reports, V$ views                              | Wait events, buffer cache hit ratio, SQL statistics |
| SQL Server    | Dynamic Management Views, Query Store               | Query performance, wait statistics, buffer usage |

Python ActiveRecord provides integration with these monitoring tools through its diagnostic interfaces.
