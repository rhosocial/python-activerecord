# A Complete Guide to Backend Development

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for implementing new database backends for the rhosocial-activerecord ecosystem. A robust backend is more than just a query executor; it's a complete implementation that includes a database-specific **SQL Dialect**, a precise **Type Adaptation** system, reliable **Transaction Management**, robust **Error Handling**, clear **Feature Detection**, and **Performance Optimizations**.

This document covers these essential pillars, outlining the required architecture, patterns, and best practices for creating a fully-featured and reliable backend.

**Important Design Constraint**: Backend implementations must be built using **native database drivers only** (e.g., `mysql-connector-python`, `psycopg`). Do not use or depend on other ORMs like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM. This ensures the ecosystem remains lightweight and independent.

## Reference Implementations

For practical examples of fully-featured, production-ready backend implementations, developers can refer to the following projects:

*   **`rhosocial-activerecord-mysql`**: A mature MySQL backend implementation.
*   **`rhosocial-activerecord-postgres`**: A robust PostgreSQL backend implementation.

These repositories provide concrete examples of how to implement all the components discussed in this guide, including their dedicated test suites. Studying their codebases, especially their `backend.py`, `adapters.py`, and `tests/` directories, is highly recommended as a practical reference.

## Backend Architecture

### Package Structure

The package structure is standardized to support namespace packages and maintain consistency.

## Key Backend Concepts

Before diving into components, it is crucial to understand the **Expression-Dialect System**, which is fundamental to how SQL queries are built and executed:

### The Expression-Dialect Architecture

The expression-dialect system separates SQL query construction from SQL generation, enabling database-agnostic query building while allowing database-specific formatting.

#### Architecture Principles
- **Expression classes** implement the `ToSQLProtocol` and define how to generate SQL
- **Each expression class** must call its dialect's `format_*` methods instead of self-formatting
- **Dialect classes** are responsible for the actual SQL formatting and parameter handling
- **Expression classes** should never directly concatenate SQL strings; they should delegate to dialect
- This pattern ensures each dialect can customize formatting behavior while maintaining security

#### Relationship Model
```
Expression.to_sql() -> Dialect.format_*() -> SQL string and parameters
```

#### Key Components
1. **Expression Formatting**: Expression classes (subclasses of `BaseExpression`) build query structure and call dialect methods for formatting. The **expression system** handles query construction by calling dialect formatting methods.

2.  **Type Adaptation**: This applies to plain Python values passed as parameters (e.g., a `datetime` object in a `WHERE` clause). The **backend is responsible** for converting these values into a format the native database driver can consume. For instance, converting a Python `datetime` object into a Python `str`. This is handled by the **SQLTypeAdapter Pattern**.

#### Expression System Modules
- `bases.py`: Abstract base classes and protocol definitions
- `core.py`: Core expression components (columns, literals, function calls, subqueries)
- `mixins.py`: Operator-overloading capabilities for expressions
- `operators.py`: SQL operations (binary, unary, arithmetic expressions)
- `predicates.py`: SQL predicate expressions (WHERE clause conditions)
- `query_parts.py`: SQL query clauses (WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, etc.)
- `statements.py`: DML/DQL/DDL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.)
- `functions.py`: Standalone factory functions for creating SQL expressions
- `aggregates.py`: SQL aggregation expressions and functions
- `advanced_functions.py`: Advanced SQL functions (CASE, CAST, EXISTS, window functions)
- `query_sources.py`: Data source expressions (VALUES, table functions, CTEs)
- `graph.py`: SQL Graph Query (MATCH) expressions

#### Important Limitation
The expression system faithfully builds SQL according to user intent, but **does not validate** whether the generated SQL complies with SQL standards or can be successfully executed in the target database. Semantic validation is the responsibility of the database engine.

## A Note on Asynchronous Backends

The architecture supports parallel synchronous and asynchronous backends. If you choose to provide an asynchronous version of your backend, it must adhere to one fundamental principle:

-   **Functional Equivalence**: The `AsyncStorageBackend` must provide the same features and functionality as its synchronous `StorageBackend` counterpart. This is achieved by implementing asynchronous versions of all I/O-bound methods (e.g., `async def connect(...)`, `async def execute(...)`) and using async-compatible mixins where appropriate. The goal is to ensure a seamless and predictable developer experience, regardless of whether they are using the sync or async version of your backend.

## The Core Components

A backend is composed of several key components that work together. The following sections detail each required piece.

### 1. The `StorageBackend` Interface

Every backend must implement the `StorageBackend` abstract base class. This is the main entry point for the core library. It is a large interface, and a concrete backend must implement all its abstract methods.

```python
# backend.py
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Optional, Tuple, Type
from ...base import StorageBackend, ConnectionConfig
from ...type_adapter import SQLTypeAdapter

class MyBackend(StorageBackend):
    """Implementation of MyDatabase backend using native driver."""
    
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self._connection = None
        self._transaction_manager = None # Must be initialized in connect()
        self._register_my_adapters() # NEW: Call to register adapters

    # --- Methods to be Implemented by Concrete Backend ---

    def connect(self) -> None:
        """Establish database connection."""
        pass
    
    def disconnect(self) -> None:
        """Close database connection."""
        pass

    def ping(self, reconnect: bool = True) -> bool:
        """Check if connection is valid."""
        pass

    def execute(self, sql: str, params: Optional[Tuple] = None, returning: Optional[Union[bool, List[str], ReturningOptions]] = None, column_adapters: Optional[Dict[str, Tuple[SQLTypeAdapter, Type]]] = None) -> QueryResult:
        """Executes a SQL query."""
        pass
    
    def get_server_version(self) -> tuple:
        """Get database server version as (major, minor, patch)."""
        pass

    def _initialize_capabilities(self) -> DatabaseCapabilities:
        """Declare all features supported by this backend."""
        pass

    def _handle_error(self, error: Exception) -> None:
        """Catch driver-specific exceptions and raise standard errors."""
        pass
    
    @property
    def transaction_manager(self) -> 'TransactionManager':
        """Return an instance of the backend's transaction manager."""
        pass

    @property
    def dialect(self) -> 'SQLDialectBase':
        """Return an instance of the backend's SQL dialect."""
        pass

    # --- Type Adaptation System Hooks ---

    def get_default_adapter_suggestions(self) -> Dict[Type, Tuple[SQLTypeAdapter, Type]]:
        """
        [Backend Implementation] Provides this backend's preferred
        type conversion strategies to the core library.
        """
        # (Full implementation shown in the Type Adaptation section)
        pass
    
    def _register_my_adapters(self):
        """
        A private helper to instantiate and register all necessary type adapters.
        """
        # (Full implementation shown in the Type Adaptation section)
        pass
```

### 2. Connection Configuration

Define an immutable configuration class for your backend.

```python
# config.py
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any
from rhosocial.activerecord.backend.config import BaseConfig

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class MyDatabaseConfig(BaseConfig):
    host: str = "localhost"
    port: int = 5432
    database: str
    user: Optional[str] = None
    password: Optional[str] = None
    # ... other options like charset, ssl_mode, etc.
```

### 3. SQL Dialect

The SQL Dialect is the backend's "translator" for database-specific syntax. This is where you define how your backend speaks SQL.

```python
# dialect.py
from rhosocial.activerecord.backend.dialect import (
    SQLDialect, ReturningClauseHandler, TypeMapping
)
from typing import Dict, List, Optional

class MyDatabaseDialect(SQLDialect):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.returning_handler = MyDatabaseReturningHandler()
    
    def quote_identifier(self, identifier: str) -> str: return f'"{identifier}"'
    def get_placeholder(self, name: str = None) -> str: return "?"
    
    def format_limit_offset(self, sql: str, limit: Optional[int], offset: Optional[int]) -> str:
        if limit is not None: sql += f" LIMIT {limit}"
        if offset is not None: sql += f" OFFSET {offset}"
        return sql
    
    def get_type_mappings(self) -> Dict[str, TypeMapping]:
        return {"INTEGER": TypeMapping("INTEGER"), "TEXT": TypeMapping("TEXT"), ...}

class MyDatabaseReturningHandler(ReturningClauseHandler):
    @property
    def is_supported(self) -> bool: return True
    
    def format_clause(self, columns: Optional[List[str]] = None) -> str:
        cols = "*" if not columns else ', '.join(self.dialect.quote_identifier(c) for c in columns)
        return f"RETURNING {cols}"
```

### 4. The Type Adaptation System

This system handles the conversion of Python values to and from formats compatible with the native database driver. This is a two-part implementation: defining the adapters, and then telling the core library how to use them.

#### a. The `SQLTypeAdapter` Pattern
Each adapter is a stateless component for converting between a source Python type and a target **driver-compatible Python type**.

```python
# From: src/rhosocial/activerecord/backend/type_adapter.py (Core Library)
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Type, Set, Dict

class BaseSQLTypeAdapter(ABC):
    def __init__(self):
        self._supported_types: Dict[Type, Set[Type]] = {}

    def _register_type(self, py_type: Type, driver_py_type: Type):
        """Registers that this adapter can convert from py_type to driver_py_type."""
        if py_type not in self._supported_types:
            self._supported_types[py_type] = set()
        self._supported_types[py_type].add(driver_py_type)

    @abstractmethod
    def _do_to_database(self, value, target_type, options): ...
    @abstractmethod
    def _do_from_database(self, value, target_type, options): ...
```

#### b. Registering Adapters in Your Backend
In your backend's `__init__` (or a helper), you instantiate and register all adapters your backend will use.

```python
# backend.py (inside your MyBackend class)
from .adapters import MyCustomJSONAdapter
from ...type_adapter import DateTimeAdapter, DecimalAdapter 

def _register_my_adapters(self):
    """Register all adapters the backend will use."""
    all_adapters = [
        DateTimeAdapter(),
        DecimalAdapter(),
        MyCustomJSONAdapter(), # Backend-specific adapter can override standard ones
    ]
    for adapter in all_adapters:
        for py_type, driver_types in adapter.supported_types.items():
            for driver_type in driver_types:
                self.adapter_registry.register(
                    adapter, py_type, driver_type, allow_override=True
                )
```

#### c. Providing Suggestions via `get_default_adapter_suggestions`
This method is the "glue". It defines your backend's preferred conversion strategy.

```python
# backend.py (inside your MyBackend class)
def get_default_adapter_suggestions(self) -> Dict[Type, Tuple[SQLTypeAdapter, Type]]:
    suggestions: Dict[Type, Tuple[SQLTypeAdapter, Type]] = {}
    from datetime import date, datetime
    from decimal import Decimal
    # ... other imports

    # Define the desired (Source Python Type -> Target Driver Python Type) mappings
    type_mappings = [
        (datetime, str),    # Prefer converting datetimes to ISO strings
        (Decimal, str),     # Prefer converting Decimals to strings for precision
        (dict, str),
    ]

    for py_type, driver_type in type_mappings:
        adapter = self.adapter_registry.get_adapter(py_type, driver_type)
        if adapter:
            suggestions[py_type] = (adapter, driver_type)
    return suggestions
```

### 5. Transaction Management
Proper transaction management is a cornerstone of any reliable database backend, ensuring data consistency and ACID compliance.

```python
# transaction.py
from contextlib import contextmanager

class MyTransactionManager:
    def __init__(self, backend_connection):
        self.connection = backend_connection
        self._savepoint_counter = 0
    
    @contextmanager
    def transaction(self, isolation_level: Optional[str] = None):
        self.connection.begin()
        try:
            yield self
            self.connection.commit()
        except Exception:
            self.connection.rollback()
            raise

    @contextmanager
    def savepoint(self, name: Optional[str] = None):
        self._savepoint_counter += 1
        name = name or f"sp_{self._savepoint_counter}"
        self.connection.execute(f"SAVEPOINT {name}")
        try:
            yield
            self.connection.execute(f"RELEASE SAVEPOINT {name}")
        except Exception:
            self.connection.execute(f"ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT {name}")
            raise
```

### 6. Error Handling
A robust backend must catch driver-specific exceptions and re-raise them as standardized `DatabaseError` subclasses from the core library (`IntegrityError`, `ConnectionError`, etc.).

```python
# In backend.py, as part of the _handle_error implementation
from ...errors import IntegrityError, ConnectionError
# import native_driver

def _handle_error(self, error: Exception) -> None:
    if isinstance(error, native_driver.UniqueConstraintViolation):
        raise IntegrityError("Unique constraint failed") from error
    if isinstance(error, native_driver.CannotConnectNow):
        raise ConnectionError("Connection failed") from error
    # Fallback to a generic database error
    raise DatabaseError(f"An unexpected database error occurred: {error}") from error
```

### 7. Other Core Components
- **Feature Detection**: A class that checks the database version to declare supported features (CTEs, Window Functions, etc.).
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced features like connection pooling and query optimization hints.

## Testing Requirements

A backend is only as reliable as its tests. The test suite should be comprehensive and cover all aspects of the implementation.

- **Connection & Configuration**: Test successful connections, disconnections, pings, and failure modes with bad configurations.
- **CRUD & Query Execution**: Verify that `execute`, `fetch_one`, `fetch_all`, etc., work correctly for all statement types.
- **Type Adaptation System**:
    - Write dedicated unit tests for each custom `SQLTypeAdapter`.
    - Test that `get_default_adapter_suggestions` returns the correct adapter and target type.
    - Write integration tests that save and retrieve models with all supported data types to ensure end-to-end correctness.
- **Transaction Management**: Test `commit`, `rollback`, and savepoints.
- **Dialect & SQL Formatting**: Test that the dialect produces correct SQL for `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`, `RETURNING`, etc.
- **Error Handling**: Test that driver-specific errors are correctly caught and re-raised as standard exceptions.
- **Expression Formatting**: Integration tests should confirm that queries using `SQLExpression` objects (like `CurrentExpression`) execute correctly.

## Preparing for Public Release

Beyond implementing the core components, a production-quality backend intended for public release should meet the following standards to ensure quality, compatibility, and maintainability:

*   **Comprehensive Backend Testing**: The backend must have its own robust test suite covering all aspects mentioned in the "Testing Requirements" section. This is the first line of defense for quality.
*   **Testsuite Compliance**: The backend must integrate with and pass the official `rhosocial-activerecord-testsuite`. This is a mandatory step to guarantee compatibility with the ActiveRecord core and other ecosystem components.
*   **Continuous Integration (CI)**: It is highly recommended to set up a CI pipeline for automated testing across different Python versions and environments. You can refer to the workflow files in the main project's `.github/workflows/` directory for a working example of how to configure this.
