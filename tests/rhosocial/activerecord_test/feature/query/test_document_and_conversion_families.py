"""The families that carry documents, sequences, casts and XML.

A JSON extraction is not always a document: `->` hands back JSON and `->>`
hands back text, so the same node class reports two families and the chain
narrows. A cast states its result in the target type, which is the only place
it can come from. And an operation over several values — GREATEST, a CASE —
answers with their common kind, or with nothing when they disagree.
