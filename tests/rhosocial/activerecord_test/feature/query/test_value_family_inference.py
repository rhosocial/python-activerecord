"""Result families, and the lattice they add up to.

A family is what decides an expression's operation surface, and it has to be
accurate in both directions. Over-narrowing removes a legal operation;
over-widening offers an illegal one. Both failures are silent — the SQL is
still produced, it is just wrong — so the families are pinned here.

The distinction that matters most is whole number against fraction. ``int`` and
``float`` share a column class, so the family has to come from the annotation
rather than the class, or "integer in, integer out" cannot be expressed and
``ceil`` of an integer claims to be fractional.

    the ``DataType`` it was handed (``type_conversion._type_value_classes()``),
